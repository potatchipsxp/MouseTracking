# MouseTracking
Analysis scripts for mouse tracking research.

in this repo is the code for a mouse tracking task we used in 2019 to gather continous mouse tracking data. In addition, the code for analysis of that dat is available in the appropriate sub folders. The data are not maintained in this repo because they are too large for frequent use of git. They are available HERE, and are pulled from this location when running the analysis script.
